# MLA-F2025-Final-Exam

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the assignment covering conceptual questions, leave-one-out cross-validation, smart fusion via generalization bounds, and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis using MRI features. The assignment includes both theoretical questions and practical implementation using Python.


1. Conceptual questions on generalization bounds, PCA, t-SNE, k-means, and assumptions 
2. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation analysis 
3. Smart fusion and generalization bounds for multiple classifiers 
4. Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis:
   - Data understanding and preprocessing 
   - Principal component analysis 
   - Clustering 
   - Classification using logistic regression, random forests, and KNN 
   - Overfitting discussion
5. Variant of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and generalization bounds
